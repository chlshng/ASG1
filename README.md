Chls's Blog
This website will be about me, it will contain my previous works and my achievements. It will provide 
employers with an idea of what type of person am I.

The Design Process
The idea and design behind the website is simplicity. The website has 4 main pages; Home, Journey, Works And Contact. This allows the user to navigate easily throughout the website so it is easier or them to look for a specifc part of the website. As an employer, they would want to see your previous works therefore, they can easily find the section to go to. The layout is also strightforward as I have organised the Journey section in 4 different components which allows one to find a specific component easily.

Features
For the home page, the users are able to find links to my LinkedIn and Instagram profile. They are also able to hover above the pictures and it would show them other pictures as well.For the journey section, I have group them into 4 different categories with drop down bars. For the Works sectipn, i have used containers to organise the works. For the form section, users can input their name, message and email. I have also made it compulsory for users to use the '@' for the email part. After the users have submit, the form processor will show the details that they have input.

Technologies Used
HTML,CSS,Javascript 

Testing 
Contact form:
Go to the "Contact" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears.
Try to submit the email section without @ and verify that a relevant error message appears.
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
